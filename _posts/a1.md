With having been trying to learn concepts of Statistical Learning, it seemed apt to me that the best way of learnoing would be dedicated documantation not only for oneself but for others as well.
The main Reference material has been been Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R
Will be documenting the Basic Concepts Rather than the chapters 
Will be attaching as many examples as possible along the way
